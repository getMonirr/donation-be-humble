# Donation-be-humble
This is a donation-like website. It is to facilitate the underprivileged people who are living very inhumane life.
this is not a responsive design. I use to build it in HTML5 and CSS3. Mostly used CSS Flexbox container. Flexbox is a great feature to build any kind of critical design.
